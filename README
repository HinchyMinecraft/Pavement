Pavement is a plugin for Spout, an plugin for Bukkit, an API for the Minecraft game server. Smelt Gravel in a furnace to get Pavement, a new blocktype. Players walking/running on top of pavement will move twice as fast as normal and jump slightly higher.

The Spout server plugin and the SpoutCraft client launcher are required to utilize this mod. Vanilla Minecraft clients will only see stone and not be sped up by the pavement.
